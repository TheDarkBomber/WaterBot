# WaterBot
Moderation bot for the Watercolor Games Discord.

## Setup
After cloning the repo, navigate to ``/config/config.json``. Open that file in a text editor of your choice. In the ``token`` field, paste your Bot User's token, preserving the double-quotes. Make any other changes if desired, such as chainging the bot's prefix or even name.

## Running
This bot was written for Node.JS v6.10.0 and assumes that you have it installed. All required packages are included, so simply navigate to the folder where ``bot.js`` is located, and run ``node bot.js`` to start it up. If configured correctly, WaterBot should state that it correctly connected to Discord.

I will be adding more info here soon, but for now, have fun!
